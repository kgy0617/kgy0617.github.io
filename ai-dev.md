# AI Development Journey

This section documents my experience developing AI systems, language models, and intelligent applications across various domains.

## Recent Projects

### Data Production Value & Data-Intensity Measurement
- **Focus**: Measuring Korea's data production value and data-intensity in occupations using NLP and LLMs
- **Technologies**: Python, NLP, GPT-4, Gemini, LLMs, Spark
- **Key Findings**: LLM-based approaches significantly outperform dictionary-based methods for Korean language analysis
- **Status**: Active research and development

### Economic Statistics System (ECOS) Modernization
- **Focus**: Migration and modernization of statistical systems
- **Technologies**: Python, Java, Oracle, Kubernetes
- **Achievements**: Automated statistical pipeline development, cloud infrastructure deployment
- **Status**: Ongoing

## Technical Stack

### Languages & Frameworks
- **Python**: Primary language for data processing, ML pipelines, and LLM applications
- **Java**: Backend development and system architecture
- **SQL**: Data management and analysis

### AI & ML
- **Large Language Models**: GPT-4, Gemini, Qwen, Gemma
- **NLP Techniques**: Text processing, morphological analysis, semantic understanding
- **Data Processing**: Spark for large-scale distributed processing

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud**: Kubernetes, Docker containerization
- **Databases**: Oracle, PostgreSQL
