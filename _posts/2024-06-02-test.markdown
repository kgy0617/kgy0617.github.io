## 1. Project Overview  
- Organization: Bank of Korea  
- System Name: Economic Statistics System (ECOS)  
- Objective: To innovate the production and dissemination of economic statistics by building an integrated data platform for both internal and external users  
- My Role: Project lead – responsible for project planning and management, conceptual design and validation of core development modules, adoption of new technologies, migration of statistical programs (from SATA/SAS to Python), database migration, evaluation of new software, installation and operation of Kubernetes clusters, overall system architecture design, and communication with external vendors  

## 2. System Environment and Technology Stack  
- Backend Technology Stack: Java, Oracle Database, Python  
- Network Structure  
    - Internal Network: Fully closed network environment  
    - External Network: https://ecos.bok.or.kr/#/ (public-facing portal)  
- Search and API Utilization: ECOS Open API for supplying economic statistics  
- Additional Technical Components: Kubernetes-based deployment and operational environment

## 3. Key Achievements  
1. Data Infrastructure Development and Transition  
   - Migration of internal statistical programs from SATA/SAS to a Python-based analysis and processing environment  
   - Redesign of the data platform including migration efforts based on Oracle Database  
2. System Architecture and Operational Environment  
   - Designed and implemented a hybrid backend architecture combining Java and Python  
   - Built a security-conscious data flow and network structure between the closed internal network and the public external network  
   - Enhanced scalability and maintainability through Kubernetes cluster installation and operations  
3. New Technology Adoption and Module Verification  
   - Designed and validated modules for statistical search and ECOS API integration  
   - Established stable integration with external partner systems through continuous communication  
   - Built system monitoring and operational management processes  

## 4. Challenges and Solutions  
- Challenge 1: Security and data-exchange issues between the closed internal network and the public external network  
  - Solution: Designed a segmented network architecture and introduced an API gateway with data-filtering mechanisms  
- Challenge 2: Risk of analytical inconsistencies and performance issues during migration of statistical programs (SATA/SAS → Python)  
  - Solution: Conducted phased refactoring, created comprehensive test cases, and implemented performance-tuning procedures  
- Challenge 3: Simultaneous management of diverse technologies (Java, Python, Oracle, Kubernetes) and multiple partner vendors  
  - Solution: Defined clear module boundaries, held regular technical reviews, and maintained structured communication and documentation  

## 5. Expected Impact and Utilization  
- Provides policymakers and researchers with a fast and reliable platform for accessing economic statistics  
- Strengthens the ability to integrate data-driven analytics and AI systems  
- Improves operational efficiency and reduces maintenance costs of the statistical production pipeline  
- Enables future expansion to AI-driven question-answering, automated statistical reporting, and dashboard visualization services
